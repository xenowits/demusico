##### Decentralized music application for the future

1. Artists distribute their songs on the blockchain.
2. Listeners listen to their songs.
3. Artists are paid real-time in crypto-currency. No middle-layer involved.

> 1. We use IPFS (https://ipfs.io/) to store the music tracks.
> 2. Code is currently deployed in testnet (Rinkeby Test Network)
> 3. We plan to think along the lines of superfluid (https://www.superfluid.finance/) for streaming money for each second of music listened.
> 4. Include all features which current music providers provide
> 5. Build an ecosystem of *openmusic*

This is the `hardhat` development environment for demusico!
